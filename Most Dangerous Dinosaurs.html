        <h2><li>Spinosaurus</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-1148109759-2048x2048.jpg" width = "500">
        <p>This was a tough one for me because both Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus are strong contenders. What finally gave T. Rex the vote was its incredible bite strength. The others were slicers whereas T. Rex was a bone crushing ripper. Having said this the rippers would usually need multiple attacks to win, but a T. Rex can win with a single bite. Regardless, I think any of these beasts could best the other given surprise. One last comment, Spinosaurus does not even contend with the three brutes listed. Its design makes it more vulnerable to attack, its weapons were not designed for large strong moving pray, and size isn't everything.

            The biggest carnivore dinosaur so far, not to mention one of the most adapted. So many people incorrect on T-Rex, saying it's the smartest and most adapted. T-Rex braincases were actually fairly small, and adapted? Not as much as Spinosaurus, which had a sail that "could" have been used to control its body temperature, and recent studies suggest it could be semi-aquatic, putting it up against prehistoric marine predators. Also, the scene in Jurassic Park III was very accurate, the T-Rex died not because of the bite wound on the neck, but because the Spinosaurus twisted and snapped the neck, paralyzing or killing it. T-Rex fanboys need to learn their places.
            
            The biggest predator of all, the Spinsaurus shall take first first place. Putting T-rex in first place is one of the weirdest things I've ever heard, and trust me, I have heard lots of weird things in my life. This predator was much faster than T-rex and think about T-rex's arm length! The spinosaurus used its sail to help it stay active, and the T-rex probably got tired quickly. Spinosaurus could hunt in water and on land, and the only thing I think could POSSIBLY take over first place is Utahraptor, but only because of its speed and that it hunted in packs. Now, if we were talking about most dangerous SHARKS, Megalodon would be first place, but we aren't. My little sister thinks stegosaurus is the most dangerous, but only because it's her favorite and it has a thagomizer (tail spikes). Easy win for Spinosaurus in that battle.
            
            It lived in the most dangerous area, but it ate mostly fish. Yes it did eat dinosaurs, but it seemed to care about fish. Thus giving the reason why it became big in the first place.

        <h2><li>Tyrannosaurus Rex</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-460716257-2048x2048.jpg" width="500">
        <p>T-REX IS AWESOME! He is the one, the only, king of all dinosaurs! There are some things Tyrannosaurus Rex has that Spinosaurus doesn't:
            1. T-Rex has bone-crushing jaws that could crush a car.
            2. He can run 25 miles per hour, faster than a person.
            3. He lives in North America.
            5. He has feathers.
            6. He could prey on sauropods (mainly Alamosaurus), hadrosaurs, and other dinosaurs. He even fights Triceratops.
            5. He lived after Spinosaurus.
            6. He is the king of all dinosaurs.
            And 7. He hunts in packs like lions.
            Spinosaurus on the other hand only has these things:
            1. He lives in Africa, not North America.
            2. His jaws are not very strong and his teeth are conical.
            3. He mainly eats fish.
            4. Lives near water.
            5. Walks on all fours, and probably wasn't that fast.
            6. His sail was fused to his backbone, so if he fell over on his side he would break his back and die.
            And 7. He went ...more
            
            T. Rex was the most dangerous, much more than Spinosaurus. T. Rex had bulk, brains, and power on his side. T. Rex was a big dinosaur, and he was definitely not a light-weight for his size. T. Rex also had a very large brain for dinosaurs. Then, T. Rex also has the largest (if not one of the largest) bite forces of anything on Earth. Spinosaurus, however, had a weak bite force and was likely a quadrupedal dinosaur and would be mostly incapable of taking a bite from T. Rex. Spinosaurus' quadruped form meant that the front claws (what people say is the best weapon they have) would not be an effective weapon because they would need to suddenly rear up and slash.
            
            Tyrannosaurus dealt with prey that, while not the biggest, were mostly equipped with natural weapons that could fend off, or even kill a T. rex, meaning it had the most dangerous prey to go up against.
            Also, it could be possible that T. rex hunted in packs, or at least in a pair. It was one of the most advanced dinosaurs around, with excellent binocular vision, exceptional smell and one of the strongest bite power of any animal. All these suggest that the environment the T. rex lived in was dangerous, hence it truly needed to be some of nature's deadliest predators.
            
            It's without a doubt T.rex, it was the pinnacle of predatory dinosaurs before the ME event. Spinosaurus was primarily amphibious and would not hold it's own against any of the big 3 (Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus). Carcharodontosaurus had conical teeth designed for cutting/serating and it would have taken a hell of a lot of bites to take down a T.rex, same as Giganotosaurus. T.rex had teeth designed to shatter armour and bones. It would take down any carnivore in probably a single bite and was thought to be very intelligent. Don't let Jurassic Park fool you, it's highly inaccurate.

        <h2><li>Giganotosaurus</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-1390283190-2048x2048.jpg" width="500">
        <p>It may not have been the biggest dinosaur, but it was either the 3rd or 2nd largest carnivore. This guy is 47 feet long, 18 feet tall and it hunted in packs. Only something from The Lord himself could kill this beast. This guy should be number 1!

            Giganatosaurus was the second biggest Theropod I think but far bigger than Carcharodontosaurus it ate sauropods and scientists even say there strong and big enough to kill a full grown titanosaurus. PS it was also bigger than T. rex and I also think they only vote because some of these Dinosaurs were famous and familiar.
            
            The size coupled with arms that are actually useful in a hunt, they overshadow the T-rex. This was proven where fossils showed they could even take down arguably the most massive dinosaurs ever.
            
            T Rex is riduculous. Famed only because of its role in Jurrasic Park. It was likely a scavenger and had short arms. But it is 4th largest carnivore dinosaur. Giganotosaurus was 3 2 position in size had large arms and hunted sauropods though spinosaurus was larger.</p>
        <h2><li>Utahraptor</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-1124675075-2048x2048.jpg"  width="500">
        <p>Pound for pound, Utahraptor was one of the deadliest killers ever, even above T-Rex, if we're speaking literally, only behind his smaller cousins like Troodon and Velociraptor. However, what he lacks in skill an speed, he makes up for size and power. 20 feet long, 8 feet tall, Utahraptor could kill a full-grown grizzly bear by using superior agility to his advantage, and was more than a match for much bigger dinosaurs, some of which they hunted alone, despite the dinosaurs being more than twice their size.

            Now, Utahraptor is the biggest raptor, and could tear to shreds velociraptor, which most of you know as a fierce mini T. Rex kind of creature which hunted in packs and was intelligent. Actually, velociraptor was the size of a Turkey, not that intelligent, and not nearly as fierce as our Jurassic park raptor. The dinosaur that was actually in Jurassic park which was called a "velociraptor" is a deinonychus. Look it up, people.
            
            This thing has 9-15 inch claws and makes the Velociraptor and Deinonychus look like a Turkey. This could rip a lion to shreds without so much as a scratch. It is the ultimate killing machine. Highly lethal. This is deadlier than the raptors from Jurassic Park. If they were still alive we would be tasty snacks and they would be the dominant species.
            
            The Utahraptor is the ultimate killing machine!
            9-15 inch sickle claws on each foot, superpowerful
            Arms with three deadly, shredding claws on each, a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth, a superfast top sprinting speed, 25 feet long, extremely smart for dinosaur standards, very maneuverable, and hunting in packs!
            The Utahraptor is the ultimate carnivore! It deserves number one!</p>
        <h2><li>Allosaurus</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-769725481-2048x2048.jpg" width="500">
        <p>Yeah sure, Allo here isn't the biggest or the physically strongest dinosaur on this list, but anything of that size and speed would've been more of a menace to modern society and us as humans than most other dinosaurs. The fact that it might've hunted in packs of OVER 40 doesn't make it any better. Nothing of that size or power should be traveling in groups that big and the fact that it does... well that just makes it an absolute menace, now doesn't it?

            Fast and can deal a lot of damage ramming with its head. But it doesn't have a strong bite, it's bite being no stronger than a regular crocodile. Its head is still its main weapon, so probably shouldn't be #6
            
            Allosaurus was not the smartest dinosaur, Troodon was. The only reason why they took down prey larger than T-rex was because they were in packs. T-rex was mostly solitary. They worked together, but not as well as more intelligent raptors. Also, raptors were one of the most intelligent animals and knew they should have stayed away from Tyrannosaurus Rex. Yet T-Rex's main and only advantage is physical structure. T-Rex was more slow and I guess less intelligent.
            
            It is quite fast and agile.And even though this carnivore is not as big as other dinosaurs, it has massive teeth and claws to make up for it.
            
            </p>
        <h2><li>Carcharodontosaurus</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-168839283-2048x2048.jpg" width="500">
        <p>Had a slightly darker look compare to the T-Rex and other bigger carnivores. It also had smaller arms such as the T-Rex, although having bigger arms gave it the ability to move better and have slightly better balance. It existed in the mid-end Cretaceous period.

            Charcarodontosaurus should be number 3, while T-rex should be 4. Shark-toothed lizard (that's the definition) had a more lethal bite than T-rex and could possibly run faster. The only thing it was not superior to T-rex is it's brain. It's brain was only half the size of T-rex's.
            
            Hm Carcharodontosaurus lived at the same time and place as Spinosaurus but was only slightly bigger than T rex, so I am thinking maybe Carcharodontosaurus should go to second place.
            
            Carcharodontsaurus had sharp long teeth for shearing through sauropods and fought against Spinosaurus, the largest carnivorous dinosaur ever to live and Sarchosuchus. It was no doubt the apex predator of Africa
            
            </p>
        <h2><li>Velociraptor</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-1155265033-2048x2048.jpg" width="500">
        <p>Velociraptor should be 3rd because they are intelligent, fast and most of all they can jump really high. They might be small and a size of a chicken or 6 foot tall but it doesn't mean that they can't be the deadliest dinosaur.

            The Velociraptor is very deadly and hunt in packs. Although, they are actually pretty small. I agree, they are probably the smartest and most intelligent dinosaurs to ever walk the Earth.
            
            Let me correct your myths. They were covered in feathers, did not hunt in packs, were the size of chickens but a million times stronger, and my favorite dinosaur.
            
            I voted for Velociraptor because they hunt in packs to take down dinosaurs twice their size. Not to mention their speed and raised sharp toe claws. So Dangerous!
            
            </p>
        <h2><li>Ankylosaurus</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-165564444-2048x2048.jpg" width="500">
        <p>The Ankylosaurus is vegetarian, but they are quite dangerous, large and staggering, and I think they don't have too much fear for carnivorous dinosaurs, although it is not as big as a Brachiosaurus, but one of the most dangerous Vegetarian Dinosaurs, their appearance is somewhat terrified, armed like tanks，and their temper doesn't seem to be good.A bad tempered dinosaur is dangerous, and the more bad tempered it is, the more dangerous it is.

            Ankylosaurus should mean armoured lizard as its back and tail are full of deadly armoured plates. At the end of its tail was a thick tail club. A big predatory dinosaur like T-Rex would haye been lucky to of survived if it gets clubbed.
            
            Ankylosaurus probably had no predators because it is too wide and long for carnivores like Tyrannosaurus, plus add a clubbed tail and a very strong armor.
            
            Ankylosaurus had low intelligence and poor eyesight but the reason it is so powerful is because of its armor. It must be flipped over just to be injured.</p>
        <h2><li>Saurophaganax</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-166352963-2048x2048.jpg" width="500">
        <p>Think of an allosaurus only bigger, nastier and mightier. Saurophaganax is an allosaurus on steroids. It's the grizzly bear of the jurassic period challenging allosaurus, edmarka and epanterias. It had huge claws and ferocious jaws. This should be at top 4 or higher.

            Saurophaganax is the Grizzly Bear of the Jurassic. He could hunt anything twice his size. He makes Allosaurus look like a coyote compared to this killer.
            
            Congratulations! Your Allosaurus has evolved into Saurophaganax!
            
            Literally the evolution of the Allosaurus!</p>
        <h2><li>Mapusaurus</li></h2>
        <img src="gettyimages-594380687-2048x2048.jpg" width="500">
        <p>Discrediting the fact that Mapusaurus was bigger than the T. rex, it was also a pack hunter, hunting in groups of 3-5. Though its justified as Mapusaurus's primary diet consisted of what appears to be the largest land animal that ever existed.

            It took down the biggest dinosaurs, like Argentinasaurus (May have misspelled that). It hunted in packs and also killed other carnivores. It was about 45 feet, bigger than a T. Rex. Definitely the most dangerous Dino.
            
            This Dino was 40 feet long, weighs 3 tons, hunted in packs and had powerful legs and tail
